Custom Data Containers

Project created during my studies in second year at ESAT.
It contains the implementation of the most usually data containers used in C++.

Includes:

	- Node
	- Vector
	- List
	- Double list
	- Queue
	- Stack

The solution can be generated with Genie, just executing the script.sh file in the tools/genie folder.
